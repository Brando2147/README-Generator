# ReadMe-Generator


## Description
When building applications it is a necessity to have a clean and concise README file. Following the DRY mantra of a developer I have decided to develop an application using Node.js along with the Inquirer package to generate read me file templates based on user prompts.

### Installation
Install Steps

```
git clone git@github.com:Brando2147/README-Generator.git

```
Run the command:
```
npm i inquirer
```    

  
## Usage
The demonstration will give you a good idea of the functionality. The app will prompt you with a series of questions to fill in data on your read me. 
You will be asked for your details, project info, etc. Once you have completed the user prompts a sample README file will be generated.
